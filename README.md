# Cart Pusher 

A snippet that can be run in the browser console while on the https://www.marmot.com homepage!

## Description

When a user scrolls to the bottom 10% of the page, an overlay will appear reminding the user of what items they currently have in their cart (if they have any). 

The overlay displays the most recent 3 items to avoid clutter. This also works for if there are more than one of the same item in the cart. 
Ex: if there are 5 items but only 3 unique items, the overay will read '5 items' instead of '3 of 5 items' because they're all being displayed.

Once the overlay is triggered and dismissed, the overlay can't be triggered for another 5 minutes to avoid annoyance. 

Also, it's *mobile responsive*!
